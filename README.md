# ðŸŒŒ C-AutoClicker

A simple Autoclicker written in **C** that allows you to choose the CPS range (Clicks per second), it was created so that you can create non-constant clicks, however they're **predictable**, as it uses a `srand()` function

## How do you use it? 

First of all, you have to run the program, nothing too complicated, you can freely copy.
Or if you have ad IDE installed on your pc that allows you to execute C code, then you can simply install the repository file

There are 5 main modes:

- **F6** allows you to switch clicks from right click to left click
- **F7** starts the autoclicker
- **F8** stops the autoclicker
- **F9** stops the program
- **F10** allows you to change the range of cps

## What is the cps range?

Cps range allows you to decide one parameter, which will be the ***minimum cps***, and a second parameter, which will be the ***maximum cps***.
The program will generate a number between those two parameters. As simple as that.
